# pokedex

The idea of this project is create a pokédex with HTML, CSS and Javascript, using my habilities developed yet.

I used the API PokéAPI like database for the pokémon search, and 2 images (one for the pokédex, and another one for de favicon).

Were also developed one search bar and two buttons for the pokémons search, being one for advance the pokémon list in one and another button for back in one pokémon.
